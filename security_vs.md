# Protecting a virtual server
{: #protect_vs}

{{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} is a service that is used to provide highly secure virtual servers. The difference to common virtual servers from a security perspective is that an instance that is created from this {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} service is running on a secured stack. Even {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} system administrators cannot access your data nor track your usage. They also do not have insight into the security status of your virtual server. In addition, they are limited in setting up or changing the configuration of your virtual server.

However, the provided virtual server is still a virtual server – which is accessible from the internet. From a security perspective, you need to protect the virtual server instance itself.


For Ubuntu, different **System Hardening Guide** documents are available. Select the strategy and implementations depending on your companies’ location and policies.
