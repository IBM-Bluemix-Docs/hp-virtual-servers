# {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Hyper Protect Virtual Servers overview
{: #hp-virtual-servers-overview}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Hyper Protect Virtual Servers is in the **Experimental** phase and is for tryout and test purpose only. You need to sign-up via the [Hyper Protect info page](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/hyper-protect-services){:new_window} and request to be added to the entitlement list before you can see this service in the Cloud Experimental catalog. The virtual server that you create with Hyper Protect Virtual Servers will be deleted after 30 days. To prevent data loss, use only test data in the current service. This restriction also applies to using Hyper Protect Virtual Servers with other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services.
