# Getting started tutorial  
{: #getting-started}

Using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} service, you can provision virtual servers on a highly secure stack with an Ubuntu Linux operating system. On such a virtual server instance, you can run a myriad of Linux applications and containerized workloads.

This introduction informs you about the prerequisites for using this service. It points you to the process for provisioning a virtual server and informs you how to retrieve information about a created virtual server.

Finally, you find a reference to a description how to log in to your new virtual server.
