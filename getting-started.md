# Getting started tutorial

Using the {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} service, you can provision virtual servers on a highly secure stack with an Ubuntu Linux operating system. On such a virtual server instance, you can run a myriad of Linux applications and containerized workloads.

This introduction informs you about the prerequisites for using this service. It points you to the process for provisioning a virtual server and informs you how to retrieve information about a created virtual server.

Finally, you find a reference to a description how to log in to your new virtual server.

## Prerequisites
{: #gs_prerequisites}

For an overview of the features and advantages of this service, read [{{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} overview](/docs/services/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-overview).

Before you start, check whether you are using the [required browser software](/docs/overview?topic=overview-prereqs-platform) for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Also, have an SSH key pair ready, which you need for creating and connecting to your virtual server instance. Read [Generating SSH keys](/docs/services/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-generate_ssh) for more information.


## Provisioning a {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} instance

You create a virtual server instance in a few steps from the user interface on the {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} page.
Read [Provisioning a virtual server](/docs/services/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-provision) for detailed information.

## Retrieving virtual server information
{: #gs_retrieving}

After you created an instance of {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}}, you can check the detailed information of your virtual server.
Read [Retrieving information about a virtual server](/docs/services/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-retrieve-info-vs) for more information.


## Logging-in to a new virtual server
{: #gs_logging}

From your client workstation, you can connect to a virtual server that exists on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} with its public IP address and your corresponding private SSH key. Read the information in [Logging-in to a new virtual server](/docs/services/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-connect_vs).
